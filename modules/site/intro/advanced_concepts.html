  <h3>JETM Advanced concepts</h3>

  <p>
    While <a href="basic_concepts.html">basic concepts</a> introduced the rationale behind JETM the following page
    covers JETM from an architecural point of view. It will offer a detailed description of its main features
    and extension points.
  </p>

  <h4>Bits and Pieces: MeasurementPoint, EtmMonitor, Aggregator</h4>

  <p>
    JETM uses a simple concept to measure and visualize application performance. With the help of an
    MeasurementPoint an
    EtmMonitor collects individual performance statistics and uses a chain of Aggregators to
    process those raw results. This aggregator chain was introduced to support flexible multistaged processing of raw
    performance data.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example an aggregator chain could buffer raw performance data and aggregate them asynchronously. Or
    simply log raw data and move the aggregation to an external process (e.g. <a
    href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/">MRTG</a>).
    The chain may be configured at EtmMonitor construction time - see <a href="five_minute_tutorial.html">five minute
    tutorial</a> -
    or using the JETM <a href="../howto/etm_manager_configuration.html">static configuration mechanism</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two different types of EtmMonitor available: The NestedMonitor collects performance data such
    that nested MeasurementPoints will retain their execution path. The FlatMonitor however will identify
    MeasurementPoints points by name and discard the execution path. Please note that nested collection
    adds some overhead (due to the usage of ThreadLocals).
  </p>

  <h4>Static vs. Non-Static Usage</h4>

  <p>
    As seen in <a href="one_minute_tutorial.html">one minute tutorial</a> JETM can be easily used just like logging
    frameworks.
    The drawback of this strategy is that application code contains performance measurement code that can't be added or
    removed
    easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore it is recommended to use <a href="monitoring_strategies.html#declarative">declarative</a> performance
    monitoring
    using AOP. One example is <a href="../howto/spring_integration.html">Springframework</a> based performance
    monitoring
    that removes the need to alter application code.
  </p>

  <h4>MeasurementRenderer - Rendering aggregated results</h4>

  <p>
    Usually the drop-in <a href="../howto/drop-in-console.html">HTTP console</a> will be sufficient to visualize
    performance results. Nevertheless a JETM <a href="../@api@/etm/core/renderer/MeasurementRenderer.html">MeasurementRenderer</a>
    can be used to access the current aggregated performance results by calling the EtmMonitor method
    <i>render(MeasurementRenderer)</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently JETM ships with three basic MeasurementRenderer implementations (Standard Out, HTML and Swing),
    however implementing a custom rendering mechanism is pretty straight forward: A MeasurementRenderer requires
    the implementation of the method <i>render(Map)</i> that provides access to all available performances
    statistics.
  </p>

  <h4>Accessing raw measurement results</h4>

  <p>
    Even though JETM should be used to generate aggregated performance results raw data logging is supported
    too.
  </p>

  <p>By addding a specific logging aggregator raw data can be written to any destination. JETM ships with adapters to
    all major
    Java&trade; logging frameworks (<i>commons-logging</i>, <i>log4j</i>
    and <i>java.util.logging</i>) that can easily be added to an existing aggregator chain and thus enable raw data
    logging transparently. One of the major advantage is that the log output will be consistent accross the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is recommended to add an asynchronous buffering aggregator in front of an logging aggregator
    in order to limit negative side effects (performancewise). A typical logging aggregator chain should look like this:
  </p>
  <center><i>BufferedTimedAggregator -> CommonsLoggingAggregator -> NestedAggregator</i></center>

  <p>
    The aggregator chain above will buffer raw performance results for a certain period of time (default is 5 seconds).
    It will then flush those results, which means writing raw performance results to a commons logging destination
    (default etm-raw-data) and aggregate them using nested aggregation.
  </p>

  <p>Now proceed to <a href="five_minute_tutorial.html"><b>five minute tutorial</b></a> to see some of theses features
    at work.
